# Implementation of Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning on Connect4 
One problem in traditional Connect Four gameplay is that it can be difficult for human players to predict the best move to make in a given situation. This is because the game has a large number of possible board positions and the optimal move can depend on the future moves of both players.

To overcome this problem, artificial intelligence techniques such as the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning can be used to help determine the best move to make in any given situation.

The main objective of implementing the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning is to develop efficient decision-making algorithms for two-player, zero-sum games, such as Connect Four. The algorithm is designed to help a computer program to play the game at a level comparable to, or even better than, human players. 

Specifically, the objectives of the Minimax algorithm are:

- To evaluate all possible moves that can be made by both players, up to a certain depth in the game tree.
- To assign a score to each possible outcome, based on how favorable it is for the player making the move.
- To choose the move that maximizes the score for the player making the move.

The objective of Alpha-Beta pruning is to optimize the Minimax algorithm by:
- Reducing the number of nodes that need to be evaluated, thus speeding up the algorithm.
- Pruning parts of the search tree that are guaranteed to lead to suboptimal outcomes, which further reduces the number of nodes to be evaluated.
